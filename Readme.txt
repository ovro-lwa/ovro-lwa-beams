The beam files can be found on: /lustre/pipeline/beam-model.

The list of beam files and the configurations are:


# File Name 		  	 Simulation Set-up										
 OVRO_LWA-DWBeam                 Dave woody's beam model.
 OVRO_LWA-FEKO                   LWA antenna in free space. No soil modelled. Would consider this an old set up
 OVRO-LWA_MROsoil_pt		 LWA antenna, with infinite soil, soil parameters from Spinelli et al. 
 OVRO-LWA_MROsoil_updatedheight  Same as above, but with new height of the LWA measured from the field.
 OVRO-LWA_MROsoil_pt_norm        LWA antenna, with infinite soil, soil parameters from Spinelli et al., normalized to Stokes I @zenith

Included in this repo are example notebooks to read the beam.s
